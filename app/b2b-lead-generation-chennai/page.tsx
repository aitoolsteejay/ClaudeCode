    body: "Automotive and auto-component B2B deals in Chennai typically move through several stakeholders, purchasing, engineering, plant heads, before anyone signs off. Chasing this through one-off calls and trade-show follow-ups is slow. A systematic, multi-touch outbound motion keeps you in front of the right buyer at the right stage, and shortens the distance between first contact and first meeting.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🏥",
    heading: "Institutional healthcare buyers you won't meet through referrals",
    body: "Chennai's hospital groups, diagnostics chains, and healthcare-services companies buy through procurement heads, clinical administrators, and hospital management, people your existing referral network rarely reaches. Direct, targeted outreach gets your offer in front of the actual decision-makers, on a schedule you control instead of waiting for word-of-mouth.",
  },
  {
    icon: "🚢",
    heading: "Export buyers found only at the next trade fair",
    body: "Exporters and manufacturers feeding Chennai's ports and logistics network often rely on trade fairs and agent introductions to find international buyers, useful, but seasonal and unpredictable. Cold email and LinkedIn outreach let you reach sourcing and procurement teams abroad directly, all year, without waiting for the next exhibition.",

const DIFFERENTIATORS = [
  {
    heading: "AI-powered systems, not manual, referral-based prospecting",
    body: "Most local outreach in Chennai still runs on personal networks and manual list-building. We run AI-assisted ICP mapping, list building, and personalisation on top of proven cold email and LinkedIn infrastructure, so volume and relevance scale together instead of trading one off against the other.",
  },
  {
    heading: "A fully managed, productized engine, not an ad-hoc favour",

  },
];

const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    q: "Do we need to be physically based in Chennai to work with you?",
    a: "No. Myntmore operates remotely for every client, so your team does not need to be in Chennai, and neither do we. Everything, strategy calls, sequence approvals, reporting, happens over calls and shared dashboards.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you only work with Chennai or Tamil Nadu businesses?",
    a: "No. Chennai is one of several Indian markets we actively serve alongside clients across India and internationally. If your buyers are in Chennai, or you are a Chennai company selling elsewhere in India or overseas, we can build the outbound motion for either direction.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before we start seeing meetings booked?",
    a: "Most clients see their first qualified conversations within three to four weeks of kickoff, once ICP mapping, list building, and outreach sequences are live. From there, meeting volume typically builds month over month as sequences are refined.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does pricing and commitment look like?",
    a: "We work on a monthly retainer with no long-term lock-in. You review results on a 30-day cycle and decide whether to continue, there is no annual contract you are stuck in if priorities change.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which Chennai industries do you have the most experience with?",
    a: "Automotive and auto-component manufacturing, healthcare and hospital-services companies, and IT/ITES businesses along the OMR corridor are where we have the deepest playbooks, though the same ICP-first approach adapts to most B2B sectors.",
  },
  {
    q: "What channels do you actually use to generate leads?",
    a: "Primarily cold email and LinkedIn outreach, layered with account-based marketing for named target accounts and AI-assisted list building and personalisation underneath all three. We pick the mix based on where your specific buyers actually spend their attention.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from hiring an in-house SDR?",
    a: "Hiring an in-house SDR in Chennai means months of recruiting and ramp-up before they are fully productive, and even then, one person can only run so many sequences at once. A managed outbound system gets multiple channels running from week one, at a fraction of the fully loaded cost of a hire, and scales without you managing headcount.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do you need from us to get started?",
    a: "A clear picture of your ICP (even a rough one works), access to a domain we can set up for outbound sending, and about an hour of your time for an onboarding call. We handle ICP refinement, list building, sequence writing, and day-to-day campaign management from there.",
