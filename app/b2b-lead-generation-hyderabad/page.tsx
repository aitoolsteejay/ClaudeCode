  { title: "Startups still running outreach off the founder's calendar", desc: "A lot of Hyderabad's growing startups have no dedicated outbound function yet, so prospecting happens in the gaps between everything else the founder is doing, which means it barely happens at all." },

const FAQ = [
  { q: "Do we need to be based in Hyderabad to work with you?", a: "No. The entire engagement runs remotely, so it doesn't matter where your team sits." },
  { q: "Do you only work with Hyderabad companies?", a: "No. We have clients in Hyderabad, but we run outbound systems for B2B companies across India and internationally." },
  { q: "How quickly can we expect meetings to start?", a: "Most clients see their first qualified conversations within 3 to 4 weeks of kickoff, once ICP mapping, list building, and sequence setup are complete." },
  { q: "What does pricing look like?", a: "We work on a monthly retainer with no long-term lock-in. You can review results every 30 days and decide whether to continue." },
  { q: "Which Hyderabad industries do you have the most experience with?", a: "IT/ITES, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and growing startups are where we've run the most campaigns, but our system adapts to any B2B ICP." },
  { q: "What channels do you actually use to generate leads?", a: "Primarily cold email and LinkedIn outreach built for long, compliance-heavy pharma and IT buying cycles, layered with account-based marketing for named target accounts, and AI-assisted list building and personalisation underneath all three. We pick the mix based on where your buyers actually spend their attention." },
  { q: "How is this different from hiring an in-house SDR?", a: "Hiring an in-house SDR in Hyderabad means months of recruiting and ramp-up before they're fully productive, and even then, one person can only run so many sequences at once. A managed outbound system gets multiple channels running from week one, at a fraction of the fully loaded cost of a hire, and scales without you managing headcount." },
  { q: "What do you need from us to get started?", a: "A clear picture of your ICP (even a rough one works), access to a domain we can set up for outbound sending, and about an hour of your time for an onboarding call. We handle ICP refinement, list building, sequence writing, and day-to-day campaign management from there." },
