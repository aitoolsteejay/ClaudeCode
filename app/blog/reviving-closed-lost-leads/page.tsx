      "Every \"maybe later\" in your CRM cost you something: sends, research, a discovery call, sometimes a proposal. They already know your name, they've heard your pitch, and at some point they had the problem you solve. Yet most teams file them away and go back to cold lists, because a new prospect feels like progress and an old one feels like failure.",

  {
    heading: "\"No\" Usually Means \"Not Right Now\"",
    paragraphs: [
      "Deals rarely die because the prospect decided they never want a solution. They die because of timing: budget was frozen, a key person left, another project took priority, or they signed with a competitor on a 12-month contract. Every one of those reasons has an expiry date. The team that shows up when it expires wins the deal, and it's almost never the team that forgot the account existed.",

  {
    heading: "Lead With What's Changed, Not \"Checking In\"",
    paragraphs: [
      "\"Just circling back\" is the fastest way to confirm you have nothing new to say. Every re-engagement message needs a reason to exist now: a new result you've delivered for a similar company, a change at their company you noticed, or a change in your own offer that fixes their original objection. If nothing has changed on either side, wait until something does.",

    heading: "Watch for People Who Moved Jobs",
    paragraphs: [
      "Your champion from a lost deal might now work somewhere else, and they already trust you. Job changes are one of the warmest signals in B2B. Track where your past contacts move, and reach out when they land somewhere new. You're not a cold vendor to them. You're the person they wanted to work with last time.",

      "Put it on the calendar. Once a month, pull every deal lost 3 to 12 months ago, tag each by segment, check for new triggers, and pick the 10 to 20 worth a fresh, specific message. It takes an afternoon. Predictable pipeline isn't only about who you haven't met yet. It's about not forgetting the people who almost said yes.",

const FAQ = [
  {
    question: "How long should I wait before re-engaging a closed-lost lead?",
    answer: "Match the wait to why the deal was lost. Re-engage timing losses near the date the prospect gave you, competitor losses 60 to 90 days before their likely renewal, and silent losses when a new trigger appears.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should a re-engagement email say?",
    answer: "Lead with something that has changed, like a new result, a change at their company, or an update to your offer that addresses their original objection. Avoid generic \"just checking in\" messages.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth tracking job changes of past contacts?",
    answer: "Yes. A past champion who moves to a new company already knows and trusts you, which makes them one of the warmest outbound targets you can have.",
