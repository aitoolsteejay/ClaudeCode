/**
 * Drop-in replacement for a plain `<button type="submit">` inside any of the
 * site's hand-rolled Zoho lead forms. These forms are real HTML POSTs (no
 * fetch/AJAX), so a slow connection makes it easy to double-click and fire
 * two full submissions with no dedupe on the receiving end. This checks
 * native form validity before disabling itself, so it never blocks a
 * legitimately-invalid submission the browser is about to reject anyway.
 * Works inside both client and server-rendered forms since it only needs
 * its own client-side state, not a handler on the parent <form>.
