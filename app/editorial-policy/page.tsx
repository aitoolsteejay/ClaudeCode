        Myntmore, a B2B outbound agency based in Mumbai, publishes everything on myntmore.com. Guides, blog posts, benchmarks and tools are written for B2B founders and sales teams. Founder{" "}

      "Myntmore is an agency that sells cold email, LinkedIn outreach, account-based marketing and related services. Pages that compare options, such as agency versus in-house or cold email versus LinkedIn, are written by a company with a commercial interest in the answer. We set out the trade-offs, including where an alternative is the better fit, but you should weigh that interest when you read them.",

        Benchmarks, such as the <Link href="/resources/blogs/b2b-outbound-benchmark-report-2026" className="underline underline-offset-2">2026 B2B Outbound Benchmark Report</Link>, are aggregated and anonymised across the accounts Myntmore has managed. No single client&apos;s data is broken out or identifiable, and ranges are shown instead of a single blended average because a flat number would hide more than it reveals. Figures labelled &quot;typical&quot; for unmanaged outbound are commonly cited industry ranges, not a specific third-party study.

        Every case study on this site describes a real client engagement. Client names are withheld because of confidentiality agreements, so a case study identifies the client by industry and market instead of by name.
