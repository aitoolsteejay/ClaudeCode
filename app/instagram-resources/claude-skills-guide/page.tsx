    whatItDoes:
      "This skill takes a single content brief and generates blog posts, email newsletters, LinkedIn posts, ad copy, and social captions simultaneously. Claude understands tone per channel so your LinkedIn post does not read like an email and your ad copy does not sound like a blog.",
    whenToUse:
      "Use this when you have one idea, announcement, or campaign and need to distribute it across multiple channels without writing each piece from scratch.",
    tools: ["Claude (claude.ai or API)", "Notion or Google Docs to store briefs", "Buffer or Typefully for scheduling"],

Generate the following from this brief:
LinkedIn post (200-250 words, hook in first line, no hashtags)
Email newsletter section (150 words, warm conversational tone)
Instagram caption (80 words, ends with a question)
Ad copy headline + 2 body variants (Google/Meta style)
Twitter/X thread (5 tweets, first tweet is the hook)

Label each format clearly. Keep brand voice consistent across all.`,
    proTip: "Save your brand voice and ICP as a Claude Project instruction. You only paste it once and every session inherits it automatically.",

My LinkedIn voice is: [3 words that describe your tone, e.g. 'direct, insightful, conversational']

[paste your raw idea]

Rules for hooks:
- First line must create curiosity or make a bold claim
- No questions as the opener
- No 'I' as the first word
- Max 12 words for the first line
- Each variant should take a different angle`,
    proTip: "Build a 'hook swipe file' inside your Claude Project. Paste your best-performing hooks there. Claude will learn your pattern and generate better variants over time.",
