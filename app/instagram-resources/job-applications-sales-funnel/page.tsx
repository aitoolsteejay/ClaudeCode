Fix the weakest stage first, not the one you like working on. If you can see where the funnel leaks, you know exactly what to fix.</p></Step>
      <Step number="02" title="Make your profile do the selling"><p>Outreach sends people to your profile, so a weak profile wastes every message you send.</p><div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3">{["Banner: state your skillset and target role in one clear line.", "Headline: say what you do and the result you deliver.", "About: write for the hiring manager&apos;s problem.", "Featured: pin your best work, projects, case studies, or videos.", "Experience: lead with outcomes before responsibilities.", "Content: share what you have learned, built, or fixed in plain language."].map((item) => <div key={item} className="rounded-xl border p-4 text-sm font-semibold" style={{ backgroundColor: "#ffffff", borderColor: "#E8E2D9", color: "#3D3D3D" }}>✓ {item}</div>)}</div><p>Post short videos covering wins, failures, and lessons.

Your goal is simple: when a hiring manager checks your profile, they see proof, not just claims.</p><Link href="/tools/linkedin-optimizer" className="font-bold underline" style={{ color: ACCENT }}>Optimise your profile with our free tool →</Link></Step>
      <Step number="03" title="Find the right hiring managers"><p>Applying through a portal puts you in a crowd. Prospecting puts you in front of the person who owns the hire. Target the hiring manager or team lead, a senior person in your function, or someone whose team is growing.</p><ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2"><li>Search your target job title plus the company on LinkedIn.</li><li>Filter by company, location, and role level.</li><li>Check who posts about hiring or team growth.</li><li>Save 20 to 30 names with their role, why they fit, and one recent post or company update.</li></ol><p>A short, researched list beats a long, random one.</p></Step>

Every touch should add something new; never send “just checking in.”</p></Step>
      <Step number="06" title="Scale it carefully"><p>For a small, specific list of 20 to 30 people, do it manually for the highest personalization. If you need more reach, LinkedIn automation can handle sending and sequencing while you personalize the inputs.</p><div className="rounded-xl p-5 border-l-4" style={{ backgroundColor: "#FEF9EC", borderColor: "#F5B731" }}><p className="font-bold" style={{ color: "#0a0a0a" }}>Automation scales the process, but it does not fix a weak profile or weak message.
