  { question: "What is the CAN-SPAM Act?", answer: "The CAN-SPAM Act is a US federal law, passed in 2003, that sets rules for commercial email. It requires accurate sender details, non-deceptive subject lines, a valid physical postal address, a clear way to opt out, and honouring opt-out requests promptly. It covers business-to-business email as well as consumer email." },
  { question: "Does CAN-SPAM allow cold email?", answer: "Yes. CAN-SPAM does not require prior consent, so cold email to US business contacts is legal as long as every message follows its rules: honest sender details and subject line, a physical postal address, a working unsubscribe option, and opt-out requests honoured within 10 business days." },
  { question: "What are the penalties for violating CAN-SPAM?", answer: "Each email that violates CAN-SPAM can bring a separate civil penalty, and the US Federal Trade Commission adjusts the maximum for inflation every year, putting it above $50,000 per email. Both the company whose product is promoted and the company that actually sent the email can be held responsible." },

But every message still needs an honest 'From' line and a real way to opt out, and violations carry real financial penalties per email."
