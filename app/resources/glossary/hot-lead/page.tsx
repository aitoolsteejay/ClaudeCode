  { question: "What is a hot lead?", answer: "A hot lead is a prospect showing clear, immediate buying intent, such as replying with interest, asking about pricing or requesting a call. Hot leads should get a personal follow-up within hours, because the interest is real but fades quickly. Fitting your ideal customer profile alone does not make a lead hot." },
  { question: "What is the difference between a hot, warm and cold lead?", answer: "A cold lead fits your ideal customer profile but has shown no interest yet. A warm lead has engaged lightly, for example by accepting a LinkedIn request or downloading a resource. A hot lead has shown explicit intent, such as asking for a call or about pricing, and needs a fast, personal reply." },
  { question: "How fast should you follow up with a hot lead?", answer: "Follow up with a hot lead within the hour during working hours, and the same business day at the latest. Interest is highest the moment a prospect replies or asks for a call, and it drops quickly after that. Give each hot lead one named owner so it never waits in a shared inbox." },
