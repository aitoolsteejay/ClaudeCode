const FAQS = [
  { question: "What does outbound sales mean?", answer: "Outbound sales means the seller makes the first contact. Your team chooses companies that fit its ideal customer profile, then reaches out by cold email, LinkedIn or phone to start a sales conversation, instead of waiting for buyers to find you. It is the opposite of inbound sales, where the buyer reaches out first." },
  { question: "What are examples of outbound sales?", answer: "Common examples of outbound sales are a cold email to a VP of Sales after their company raises funding, a LinkedIn connection request and follow-up to a procurement head, a cold call to a target account, and an account-based campaign that reaches several stakeholders at one company at the same time." },
  { question: "Is outbound sales the same as telemarketing?", answer: "No. Telemarketing is one older form of outbound, usually high-volume phone calls to consumers or broad lists. Modern B2B outbound sales targets specific companies and roles, mostly through personalised email and LinkedIn, with phone calls as one channel among several rather than the whole motion." },

Its main risk is relevance, since outbound that isn't tightly targeted reads as spam and burns both your sending domain and your reputation."
