Then check how it sources data, how it handles DPDP and TRAI rules, how it defines a qualified meeting, what the full price is including GST, who does the work and what proof you can verify.

                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#3D3D3D" }}>
                    Selling to Indian companies and selling from India to the US, UK or Middle East are different jobs. Domestic B2B buying is relationship-heavy: LinkedIn, phone and WhatsApp (with opt-in) often matter as much as email, and decisions can involve a promoter or family owner as well as the functional head. Selling abroad needs copy that reads as native, sending windows in the buyer&apos;s time zone and compliance with laws like CAN-SPAM and GDPR. Ask for case studies in the country and buyer role you actually target, not just a total client count.

                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#3D3D3D" }}>
                    Global B2B databases are often thinner on Indian mid-market and SME companies than on US ones, so an agency that relies on a single tool will hit gaps fast. A good agency combines sources, researches accounts by hand where needed, and verifies every email before it is sent, because bounces damage the sending domain for everyone on it. Ask which sources they use for your segment, how they verify contacts, and what bounce rate makes them pause a campaign.

                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#3D3D3D" }}>
                    India&apos;s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 governs how personal data is collected and used, including work emails and phone numbers. Its rules were notified on 13 November 2025, and most obligations for businesses apply from 13 May 2027, with penalties of up to ₹250 crore. Commercial calls and SMS also fall under TRAI&apos;s rules on unsolicited commercial communication, including the Do Not Disturb registry, and WhatsApp Business requires opt-in before a business messages someone.

                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#3D3D3D" }}>
                    Most disputes with lead generation agencies come down to this one definition. A useful one names the company profile, the role of the person, and whether the meeting has to actually happen to count. Ask what happens when a prospect doesn&apos;t show up, whether no-shows are rebooked or replaced, and who qualifies the meeting before it reaches your calendar.

                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#3D3D3D" }}>
                    Agencies in India usually charge a monthly retainer, a fee per qualified meeting, a fee per lead, or a mix. Each rewards the agency for something different: per-lead pricing rewards volume, per-meeting pricing rewards booked calls, and a retainer rewards running the whole system well. Then check the full cost. Services in India attract 18% GST, and setup work, sending domains, inboxes and tool subscriptions are often billed separately. Ask for one quote with every line shown, and compare agencies on cost per qualified meeting that actually happened.

                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#3D3D3D" }}>
                    The person who pitches you is rarely the person who writes your emails. Ask who builds your list, who writes the copy, who watches deliverability and who you talk to every week, and whether they are employees or subcontractors. Ask to meet the account lead before you sign. An agency that runs a real system will be glad to show you the people running it.
