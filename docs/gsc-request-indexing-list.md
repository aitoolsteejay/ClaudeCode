# Google Search Console Request Indexing Priority Checklist

This checklist organizes the URLs that require manual "Request Indexing" submission in Google Search Console (GSC). Google imposes a daily inspection/request quota (typically 10 to 12 requests per day), so process these in batches following the schedule below.

---

## How to Submit URLs in Google Search Console

For each URL in the priority batches below:
1. Open Google Search Console for property `https://www.myntmore.com/`.
2. Paste the full URL into the top search bar ("Inspect any URL in https://www.myntmore.com/").
3. Click **Test Live URL** (top right).
4. Wait for the test to complete, then click **View Tested Page**:
   - Check the **Screenshot** tab: Ensure the rendered page displays Myntmore content and layout.
   - Check the **HTML** tab: Verify `<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.myntmore.com/..." />` points to the exact same page.
   - Check the **HTTP Response**: Ensure HTTP status is 200.
5. If the live test confirms indexability, click **Request Indexing**.
6. If the live test displays foreign content or errors, treat as a DNS/security issue immediately.

## Batch 1: Urgent - Wrong-Canonical Overwrite (Days 1 & 2)

**Issue:** Google has historically flagged these URLs as "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" and attributed canonical ownership to unrelated external domains (`747live.bet` or `winzir.ph`) based on stale crawls (July to August 2026).
**Status in Code:** All 19 pages return HTTP 200, self-referencing canonical tags, and `index, follow` robots headers.

## Batch 2: Stale "Excluded by 'noindex' tag" Case Studies (Day 3)

**Issue:** GSC reports these 9 case studies as excluded by a `noindex` tag from crawls on 10-11 October 2026.
**Status in Code:** Every page is currently `index, follow` with canonical tags. A single live inspection and indexing request will clear Google's stale record.
